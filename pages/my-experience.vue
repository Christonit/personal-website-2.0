                    <p>
                      Builder.io is a visual headless CMS where you register the
                      components through their SDK and then it is available in a
                      drag-and-drop interface on their website. The workflow
                      usually was to strip down existing components and
                      sometimes create smaller ones, create types with
                      TypeScript, register them with the SDK, rebuild the UI in
                      the web interface, and test that all the Context state
                      management still worked as was expected.

                      For my current employer, I worked for over a year part
                      time in a Web3 crypto startup. It was a Solana network NFT
                      store using (who could have guessed it) the solana API and
                      Metaplex Storefront where I was the front end lead for a
                      small team. I did some UI design, react and node.js
                      backend development.

                    <p>
                      Aside from offloading client side stuff to server side to
                      gain performance improvements, some of the features we
                      worked were a cross market transaction logs parser, an NFT
                      aggregator were we could buy stuff from magic eden and
                      Open Sea and the responsive version. Sadly the project
                      died before we could launch but I learned a ton about the
                      tech side of the crypto world.
